## 📌 Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a common NLP (Natural Language Processing) task used to determine the emotional tone of text data.  
In this project, we analyze tweets and classify them based on sentiment. The model learns patterns from a labeled dataset and predicts sentiment for new text input.
